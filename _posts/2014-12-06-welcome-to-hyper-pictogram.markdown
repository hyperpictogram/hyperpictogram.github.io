Hyper Pictogram is the architecture of accessible pictograms for humanity and machinery.

The architecture of Hyper Pictogram is as same as [Creative Commons]. Various licenses of Creative Commons have their own pictograms and RDF metadata definitions. Similarly, Hyper Pictograms have URIs and alternative RDFs.
